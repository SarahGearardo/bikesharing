# Bike Sharing

## Project Overview</br>

This project was to gather data using Citi Bike data in New York City and seeing how we can use that data to set up a bike sharing program in Des Moines.

The link contains seven slides and a story for the challenge with explanations of each slide in the story.

Here we have our gender breakdown. There are signifigantly more male riders than female or unknown gender-types.<br>

Most riders only rent bikes between twenty to thirty minutes.<br>

The previous statistic doesn't change when diving trip time by genders. All genders seem to rent bikes for twenty to thirty minutes maximum and very few will rent a bike for over two hours.<br>

Looking at trips by weekday, the morning commute time seems like a popular time to rent bikes as most bikes are rented at 8am and then again at 5 or 6pm on the weekdays. On the weekends, There is a pretty even split during the mid-day hours, with a drop off after 7pm.<br>

More males tend to rent bikes during the morning commute on the weekdays, which is no surprise considering they are the biggest userbase.<br>

Here is a list of our userbase. Most users are also subscribers to the service.<br>

When looking at the user trips by gender per weekday, most of the male users are also subscribers to the service. They tend to use the service more during the week.<br>


## Summary and Additional Suggestions</br>

In summary, customers typically rent bikes for short durations, most lasting no longer than thirty minutes and very few lasting over two hours. The userbase is mostly made up of men and they tend to use the bikes during the week during the morning and evening commute. From the data it looks like people use the bikes to get to work, get home and then they may go out throughout the day using the bikes to pick up coffee of lunch. People tend to rent bikes on the weekend as well, with most of the rending happening during midday, dropping off after 7pm.

There are two additional analysis that can be performed with the data set to give additional data. One analysis that should be explored is location pick up/drop off by gender. It would be interesting to explore where men and women are picking up and dropping off bikes. Are there any differences in locations or what they're doing? Althought we won't be marketing to people in New York, it could probably help us decide where in Des Moines to place 

The second additional analysis that can be performed is finding the amount of ride time of subscribers vs. customers. How long are customers renting vs. subscribers? Would that help uncover some data that could help us turn customers into subscribers?
